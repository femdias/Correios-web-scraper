# Correios-web-scraper
Code in Python for doing web scrapping on the Correios wesite

The code "Correios web scraping - from CEP to address.py" uses the Selenium library in Python to extract the adress, neighborhood and city of a CEP (Brazilian post code) from the Correios (state-owned postal service company) website. In this repository, I also added the dataset "sample.xlsx", with a sample of 100 CEPs, and "sample_with_address.xlsx", the code's output.

Hope this can help someone, send me a message if you have any question about it.
